<h2>Health Care Data</h2>

<p1 class='firstP'><font color='#1251b7'>Health care data is gathered in many places such as hospitals and clinical trials. But, the data can not be used unless it is organized. Computer systems today make it easier to go through information and find the patterns and problems.</font></p1>

<p2 class='secondP'><font color='#1251b7'>Proteomics Data is the large scale study of proteins and Genomic Data is the study of genes, two of the most prominent research areas in medicine. All of these types of data can be used to produce algorithms, data mine, which finds patterns in large sets of data., and then for modeling and simulation which shows probable results and events.

<p4 class=''><strong><font color='#7af9d3'>Risk:</font></strong><br> </br><font color='#1251b7'>In 2015, 80 million customers of Anthem, one of largest health insurance firms in the US. Only names and addresses were stolen, but details of illnesses and treatments were also at risk. Stolen patient records can sell for $10 each, about 10-20 times more than stolen credit card numbers. These records can be used to create fake ids to purchase medical equipment, drugs, or file false insurance claims.

<p3 class= 'thirdP'><strong><font color='#7af9d3'> Effects of Technology</font> </strong><br> </br> <font color='#1251b7'>Digitized MR allow for easier access to patient information. EHR forms allow for doctors to access information like allergies , and can be accessed at any medical facility, and are especially useful if patients are unconscious or unable to communicate. EHRs also allow researchers to access patient information to find cures for common illnesses or a widespread outbreak. The switch for paper to electronic records reduced the cost of outpatient care by 3% according to a study at the University of Michigan.</font> <p3>
