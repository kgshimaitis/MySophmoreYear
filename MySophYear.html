<h2>Health Care Data</h2>

<p1 class='firstP'><font color='#1251b7'>Health care data is gathered in many places such as hospitals and clinical trials. But, the data can not be used unless it is organized. Computer systems today make it easier to go through information and find the patterns and problems.</font></p1>

<h3> Gather:</h3>

<ul class='list1'><font color='#1251b7'>
  <li>Clinical Research</li>
  <li> Healthcare Data</li>
  <li> Patient Records</li>
  <li> Proteomics and Genomic Data </li></font>

  <li>Data Mining</li>
  <li> Modeling</li>
  <li> Simulation</li></font>
</ul>
<p2 class='secondP'><font color='#1251b7'>Proteomics Data is the large scale study of proteins and Genomic Data is the study of genes, two of the most prominent research areas in medicine. All of these types of data can be used to produce algorithms, data mine, which finds patterns in large sets of data., and then for modeling and simulation which shows probable results and events.

  You can work in government, hospitals and clinics, industry, consulting or academia. You would need skills in computer science, organizational theory, information and management science, and cognitive science, the study of thought, learning, and mental organization.

<p4 class='fourthP'><strong><font color='#7af9d3'>Risk:</font></strong><br> </br><font color='#1251b7'>In 2015, 80 million customers of Anthem, one of largest health insurance firms in the US. Only names and addresses were stolen, but details of illnesses and treatments were also at risk. Stolen patient records can sell for $10 each, about 10-20 times more than stolen credit card numbers. These records can be used to create fake ids to purchase medical equipment, drugs, or file false insurance claims.

<p3 class= 'thirdP'><strong><font color='#7af9d3'> Effects of Technology</font> </strong><br> </br> <font color='#1251b7'>Digitized MR allow for easier access to patient information. EHR forms allow for doctors to access information like allergies , and can be accessed at any medical facility, and are especially useful if patients are unconscious or unable to communicate. EHRs also allow researchers to access patient information to find cures for common illnesses or a widespread outbreak. The switch for paper to electronic records reduced the cost of outpatient care by 3% according to a study at the University of Michigan.</font>

  <strong><font color="#7af9d3">Use in Hospitals:</strong></font><br></br><font color='#1251b7'>Big hospitals employ computer systems to maintain patient records. It is often necessary to maintain detailed records of the medical history of patients.
   Computers can keep track of prescriptions and billing information. They can be used to store the information about the medicines prescribed to a patient as well as those, which cannot be prescribed to someone.
  Many of the modern-day medical equipment have small, programmed computers. Many of the medical appliances of today work on pre-programmed instructions. The circuitry and logic in most of the medical equipment is basically a computer. The functioning of hospital-bed beeping systems, emergency alarm systems,
 X-ray machines and several such medical appliances is based on computer logic.
 Computer software is used for diagnosis of diseases. It can be used for the examination of internal organs of the body. Advanced computer-based systems are used to examine delicate organs of the body. Some of the complex surgeries can be performed with the aid of computers. The different types of monitoring equipment in hospitals
 are often based on computer programming.Many of the modern methods of scanning and imaging are largely based on the computer technology.Computers are widely used for the generation of 3-D
images in medicine. 3-D printing has also been a new way of making sythetic organs, tissues, bones, and prothestics that past couple of years.One of the newest types of technology is computer assited surgical systems, which are regulated by the FDA, but can be used in common procedures like gall-bladder removal, a hysterectomy or a prostatectomy. Technology has allowed for quick and easy communication between doctors and pateints, or doctors working together from different parts of the world.
